# MATLAB-TelloDrone
Fly the Ryze Tello drone with MATLAB Support Package for Ryze Tello Drones

## Description

This repo is all about testing the [MATLAB Support Package for Ryze Tello Drone](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74434-matlab-support-package-for-ryze-tello-drones). I have started this repo by simply copying the examples provided with the support package. Then I started tweaking the code to fit my needs.

### Disclaimer

These scripts only allows you to fly the drone from command prompt. If you want to learn more about the dynamics of the drone and write your own flight controler, I invit you to watch this [Drone Simulation and Control series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn8PRpmsu08oOLBVYYIwwN_nvuyUqEjrj)
